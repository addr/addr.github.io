I'm a software geek at heart, although I'm passionate about things where [technology and liberal arts intersect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlI1MR-qNt8). Code is fun, but what really keeps me up at night is everything else. How can we harness the incredible power of technology and put it in the hands of everyone else? What role should tech play in our lives? Where is the line between creating because we can, and creating because we should?

In other words, I'm fascinated by the liberal arts of technology: psychology, design, business, culture, philosophy, and everything else in between. I went to school thinking I would get into politics, almost majored in philosophy, then went into non-profit fundraising, which turned into digital marketing, and now I write software for a living. Let that be a lesson, kids: almost no one knows what they want to be when they grow up. And that's totally fine.

If you've read this far, you might want to check out a few other things about me:

 * [Check out my LinkedIn page for more than you ever wanted to know about my work history.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andydrice)
 * [I've also got this blog thing where I occasionally write stuff.]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog)
 * [I also keep my projects list semi-updated with stuff I'm doing.]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects)

I love talking to new people and I read every email, so don't hesitate to drop me a line. You should know that I'm currently on an extended social media hiatus. If you want to contact me, send me an email! I will usually respond to LinkedIn requests, but I much prefer email and the good 'ol fashioned phone.

### What's this site about?
When I originally thought about putting up a personal blog and website, my first thought was: what's the point? There is already so much noise, and the last thing I want to do is add to it.

But noise is only such if you're fighting to be heard. And that's not what this site is about.

This site is my personal sandbox, currently serving as:

  * An outlet for getting things out of my head. I think that writing something down is the best way to figure out what you believe.
  * Public record for personal accountability. Even if no one reads it, a public commitment to something makes me less likely to falter. This is especially helpful for keeping my focus and [making progress on my current projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).
  * Lessons learned for my future self, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/2do). It's easy to forget stuff unless you write it down and keep it somewhere you will refer to later.
  * Reading list and notes. I take notes on most nonfiction books I read, and it's nice to have somewhere with a definitive list of those notes and books I want to read.
