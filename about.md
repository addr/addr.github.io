[Here's what I'm currently up to.]({{ site.baseurl }}/now)


### What's this site about?
When I originally thought about putting up a personal blog and website, my first thought was: what's the point? There is already so much noise, and the last thing I want to do is add to it.

But noise is only such if you're fighting to be heard. And that's not what this site is about.

This site is my personal sandbox, currently serving as:

  * An outlet for getting things out of my head. I think that writing something down is the best way to figure out what you believe.
  * Public record for personal accountability. Even if no one reads it, a public commitment to something makes me less likely to falter. This is especially helpful for [keeping my focus]({{ site.baseurl }}/now) and [making progress on my current projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).
  * Lessons learned for my future self, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/2do). It's easy to forget stuff unless you write it down and keep it somewhere you will refer to later.
  * Reading list and notes. I take notes on most nonfiction books I read, and it's nice to have somewhere with a definitive list of those notes and books I want to read.
