title: The Logical Fallacy of Silicon Valley's Diversity
permalink: /logical-fallacy-of-silicon-valley-diversity
excerpt: Much noise has been made about the lack of diversity in Silicon Valley. But the problem isn't that companies don't hire more women or people of color, the problem is that the pervasive mindset in Silicon Valley towards hiring is based on a common logical fallacy called the genetic fallacy. So it should come as no surprise that the common solution to the diversity problem is based on the same fallacy. True diversity means being open to (and seeking) different opinions and ideas.

If you've followed the discussions within tech industry communities like Hacker News for any length of time, you will have quickly come to the conclusion that there is a big perceived problem of diversity in Silicon Valley, namely that most everyone is young, white, male, and probably comes from a privileged background.

The response from tech companies to this perceived problem has mostly been to hire someone, usually an outside consultant, to 'fix' this diversity problem by hiring more people not white or male, then writing about it in a diversity report where they pat themselves on the back for hiring more people not white or male.

But that doesn't solve the problem, it just perpetuates the fallacious mindset that caused the problem in the first place.

### The Genetic Fallacy in Silicon Valley
[The genetic fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/genetic) is one where:

> You judged something as either good or bad on the basis of where it comes from, or from whom it came.

In Silicon Valley culture, this is manifested in what Parker Thompson (of [Startup L. Jackson fame](https://twitter.com/startupljackson)) called Silicon Valley's "obsession with status and pedigree", to which I would also add youth. Of course, discussion of this fallacy in the context of Silicon Valley isn't complete without mention of Mark Zuckerberg's [famous, erstwhile quote](http://www.cnet.com/news/say-what-young-people-are-just-smarter/):

> I want to stress the importance of being young and technical," he stated, adding that successful start-ups should only employ young people with technical expertise. (Zuckerberg also apparently missed the class on employment and discrimination law.)

>"Young people are just smarter," he said, with a straight face, according to VentureBeat. "Why are most chess masters under 30?" he asked. "I don't know...Young people just have simpler lives. We may not own a car. We may not have family."

I don't mention this to call out Zuckerberg, only to point out that the fallacy is so ingrained that one of Silicon Valley's biggest success stories apparently didn't think twice about saying this in a public forum. It is one of the biggest enduring mysteries to me how tech culture prides itself on intelligence and meritocracy, yet falls victim to this very common and obvious logical fallacy again and again.

And on the flip side of the coin, the 'solution' to simply hire greater percentages of non-white, non-male workers comes from the exact same flawed thinking.

Want to fix diversity? Start by recognizing this fallacy in your own thinking on who to hire. This isn't to say you should ignore where someone went to school, where they worked, etc... But those things aren't automatic indicators that someone is a better fit or more qualified than someone else who doesn't fit the description.

### What is Diversity?
Before I get into this, let me say that I don't consider myself an expert on diversity. I'm as susceptible as anyone to my own biases of background, and I fully recognize that, being white and male, it is impossible for me to fully understand the indignity of discrimination. This is simply my observation based on my limited experience, and I always welcome a different viewpoint on diversity. [Feel free to email me to tell me I'm wrong](mailto:andy@andydrice.com). I read every one.

When we talk about diversity in the work place, I think what we're really talking about is the willingness of everyone to embrace, and indeed encourage, different ideas, viewpoints, and opinions (especially those we don't agree with!) It is about leaving your own echo chamber and recognizing that what makes us different is what makes us, as a species, strong and vibrant. Evolution (and therefore survival) only works if a species adapts, and adaptation by definition is becoming different.

For most species this happens unconsciously. But I believe we (as humans) are unique in that we ultimately have a choice. We can choose to stay in our own echo chamber and eventually die out, or we can look for the differences that will help us evolve, survive, and ultimately thrive.

Diversity isn't some politically correct concept shoved down unwilling throats. It is literally a biological imperative that, if ignored, will eventually result in the extinction of the human race.

Now you might be thinking: isn't that a bit of hyperbole? Sure it is, but that doesn't make it any less true. If you think of companies through the evolutionary lens as mini-species with their own unique ecological forces that shape them, you can see this concept at work. Why do companies ultimately fail, especially those that once seemed so dominant? Failure to adapt. Or, put another way: failure to become **different**.

### What's the Solution?
Look to biology. In an effort to adapt and survive, a species will go through many changes, and not all of them are successful. Evolution is essentially one long experiment at being different, with those who remain the same eventually die out. It is impossible to know at any given point what differences will ultimately result in the next successful adaptation, so the only thing you can do is consistently embrace differences you believe will make you stronger.

For the most part the human race has evolved past physical differences as a significant indicator of evolutionary success. It isn't difficult to imagine how being bigger, stronger, or faster gave certain people a huge advantage in the days of the caveman. But now? It is more about mental differences than physical ones.

When I say 'mental differences' I don't mean raw intelligence. Intelligence is a part of it, but **mindset** is even more important. Mindset has much more to do with how you view the world and other people. Note that I'm not talking about just the [fixed vs. growth mindset meme](http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/), I'm talking about everything that goes into a person's mindset: their psychology, personality, emotions, self esteem, etc... So if we accept the premise that our mental differences, rather than our physical ones, are ultimately what will determine successful adaptation, that means we should actively seek out and embrace those with different mindsets.

By far the most important mindset indicator for every person your surround yourself with is their individual willingness and ability to understand and embrace another mindset, especially if it is uncomfortable or runs counter to their own deeply held beliefs. 

### How to I Evaluate Mindset?

The key to this is understanding how to evaluate someone's mindset, as well as understanding your own and the people you work with. How to do this is left as an exercise to the reader, but I believe there are a few key indicators.

1. A tendency to make decisions based on emotions or logic.
2. Evidence of continual learning/improvement (or lack thereof).
3. Personal priorities. Is someone ambitious and career oriented, or are things outside of work more important?
4. Introvert vs. extrovert.
5. Response to failure, professionally or personally.
6. Response to interpersonal conflict, professionally or personally.
7. Playful/friendly vs. serious/business-like.
8. Planner vs. doer.
9. Optimist vs. pessimist.
10. Response to change, professionally or personally.

It is worth reiterating that having mindset **differences** is what is important. Our tendency is to look at these types of indicators and evaluate whether they are 'good' or 'bad', i.e. why would you want to hire someone who doesn't show evidence of continual learning or improvement? Let's think about that - what might happen if you have a team made up only of people who are always looking to the next thing and are unhappy if they aren't doing something where they are learning something new? For starters:

  * This team would probably be more likely to rush into some shiny new framework or process because they wanted to learn it, not because it is good for your business
  * They would probably be unhappy doing routine work, of which there will always be plenty

On the other hand, someone who looks like they've stagnated in their career might be more likely to balance the tendencies of the continual learners by preferring to stay with the tried and true.

Approach to failure is another good example. Tech culture likes to celebrate failure, but what happens when you have a team of people with no fear of it? That team is probably more likely than others to take too many unnecessary risks, but you can't have a team where everyone is afraid of failure lest you never take any risks.

### Conclusion

Perhaps the most important, and most difficult part about promoting diversity in a company is hiring people who embrace different mindsets. It is extremely difficult to empathize and understand people who are different from us, and that is ultimately the most important mindset of all.

So next time you find yourself about to hire someone based on things like where they went to school, their gender, or race, stop. Don't judge, but instead try to understand. Ask yourself: How does this person see the world? Why might they see the world that way?

Embrace those differences, and hire people willing to do the same.
