excerpt: After all the breathless anticipation of new Macbook hardware, the Internet glitterati has been absolutely seething with anger at what they perceive as a slap in the face by Apple. As a self-proclaimed 'professional' user of Macs, I admit to being a bit puzzled by the Macbook Pro updates as well, which have been largely derided by a loud minority of users. While many theories as to Apple's thinking have been floated, the most commonly accepted one goes something like this: the 'professionals' crying foul are a revenue rounding error to Apple, and the money is in making a computer for everyone else. For Apple, that means a computer which trades traditional power user concerns (raw power, configurability, etc...) for better battery life, thinner form factor, and those function row keys that no one else really uses. But this seems too simplistic to me, so I wanted to dive into this to ferret out why.

As any designer will tell you, design is primarily about trade-offs. It is a careful dance of choosing what to emphasize and what to ignore, of focusing a user's attention on one thing at the expense of another. A good design will start with a picture of the user in mind (ideally one based on reality), then scuplt a design by slowly chipping away anything that doesn't solve the user's most burning problem. 

What role do personal computers fill in this era of mobile touchscreens? What role should they fill? To me, this is the most important question. The personal computer started its life as a general purpose machine of enormous capability. In our ceaseless ingenuity, we humans have found ways to use this general purpose machine that no one could've imagined.

But the personal computer isn't the best at everything. If nothing else, smartphones and mobile devices have emerged as better tools to do many of the things popularized by the personal computer (internet browsing, digital communication, entertainment consumption, etc...). You can see this in the relative usage of computers vs. mobile devices within each of these activities: increased mobile usage goes up while computer usage goes down. In this vein, it is only natural that we look for alternate mediums with which to perform complex use cases that personal computers are still best for.

What use cases are computers still good for where mobile devices just aren't? In general: specialized, necessarily complex activities that often require maintenance of numerous different contexts simultaneously in a specialized domain. Creation tasks where the defining advantages of mobile devices (portability, small form, constrained input, low cost) are either of little concern or detrimental. 
 * Coding
 * Anything requiring multiple simultaneous contexts

Who are these 'professional' computer users who seem so upset that Apple isn't paying attention to them?
