title: Trump and the Authenticity Crisis of American Politics
permalink: /authenticity-crisis
excerpt: I used to think that Trump got elected simply because he's an extraordinary salesman. He is at that, but after finding that explanation extremely unsatisfying (and numerous others put forward, such as the force of the middle class white vote), I came up with another that I find infinitely better: Trump is the only major political candidate to satisfy our demand for authenticity. No one else came close.

We crave authenticity. No, scratch that, we NEED authenticity. We've always needed it. We don't like it when we think someone is faking it, especially if what they're faking is important to us. You can't trust a faker, and why would you give the time of day to someone who you think is lying to you all the time? 

We've become especially good at finding fakers in the media. And since we all have a social media account, the fakers can't just scream at us from a megaphone. We can scream back, and we do. We can also ignore them, since we have infinitely more things to give our attention, which wasn't always the case. 

Most of the 'establishment' (I hate that word, but it applies here) has come around to this fact. Large companies have slowly stopped trying to present themselves as some gray, bland entity when they talk to us, celebrities don't think twice about posting intimate home pictures on Instagram, etc... Reality TV is still a thing! But politics... not so much.

If anything, politics and politicians have gotten more *inauthentic*. We've seen it for years, with most politicians essentially becoming two people: Mr. Campaign and Mr. Incumbent (not to mention Mr. Personal, or a completely different person at home). Mr. Campaign and Mr. Incumbent both say they care about us, but what they do says otherwise. Hilary Clinton was the epitome of the inauthentic politician. Scandal after scandal, flip flop after flip flop over many years, and the only lasting impression of her is that she's a faker of the highest order. Even if she says she agrees with us on things that are important to us, how do we know that's true, and not just the faker? 

Enter Donald Trump. In pretty much every way, Trump has acted the complete opposite of a typical politician, and he has done it in a way that seems *authentic*. Whenever you hear him speak, you get an indelible impression that this isn't some faker showing you a carefully crafted facade, this is an actual person telling me what he thinks. It doesn't matter so much that I find what he is saying distasteful (I have to hear distasteful people in my family all the time!), it matters that he's not faking it. And whatever he believes, at least we know he'll always be straight with us.

And Trump isn't faking it. What's worse is that he really is the fairy tale mirror that tells us what we want to hear. When he's reflecting on to you, he actually *believes* it. And when he is reflecting on to someone else who believes the opposite of you, he actually *believes* it. There is no faking because there is no canonical Trump, no secret Trump that is hidden under all the reflections that says *this is what I really believe*. It is all id and ego, no superego, and that is terrifying. 

I don't think Trump voters are racist, stupid, or ignorant as so many others seem to believe. If you talk to a typical Trump voter (instead of the nut jobs you only hear about in the media), you will probably find a normal, nice person who shares a lot of your same values. These are authenticity voters, those who have had enough with the monstrosity of the modern politician who says whatever they need to get elected. They aren't necessarily electing Trump, they are sending a message that we've let politicians deceive us for far too long, and if sending someone like Trump to the White House means that whole rotten system gets blown up, then so be it. 

I maintain that Trump got elected because of his seeming authenticity, *despite* everything else. A vote for Trump was a vote against the fakers, of which Hilary was only a symptom. It was a vote for restoring authenticity to American politics, and it was a vote on the future of our political system, not a vote for Trump, the candidate. 

I respect that, and you should too.
