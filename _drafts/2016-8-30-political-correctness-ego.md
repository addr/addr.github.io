title: The Real Tragedy of Political Correctness
permalink: /political-correctness
excerpt: For the record, I think the whole trend of political correctness is way overblown. But this phenomenon, no matter how small, is a symptom of something much more tragic: the collective reinforcement and validation of ego. Instead of being called out for the fraudulent fantasy that it is, an individual's ego is being held up as the immutable manifestation of an individual's self-worth that must be protected.
