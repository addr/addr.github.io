title: User 0
permalink: user0
excerpt: As a profit-making company, Apple has thrived under Tim Cook. But I've had a palpable feeling over the past few years that the user experience for which Apple is famous has been slipping, a feeling that has been difficult to put my finger on. There are examples, such as the questionable wholesale change to flat design after iOS 7, as well as the famously unintuitive first generation Apple Watch interface. One reason, I think, is that after the death of Steve Jobs, Apple has no user 0. Just like patient 0 is where a disease emanates from, user 0 is a central user or figure where all user experience emanates from. I think so much of Apple's success in UX comes from the fact that Steve Jobs was Apple's user 0 for so long. Unlike the vast majority of us, he had the unique ability to really put himself in a user's shoes and guide Apple toward UX designs that worked for all users, instead of designers or engineers (but even he wasn't perfect! See: Apple's brief foray into over the top skeumorphism). It seems that there is currently no one at Apple who fits that role, or who recognizes that Apple's success in UX is primarily a result of Steve's role as user 0. The solution isn't to look for another user 0, but rather do what literally every other competent UX professional does: user testing.
