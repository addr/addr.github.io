title: The End of Consumption
permalink: /consumption
excerpt: So much of the Western lifestyle is centered around consumption: buying things, using things, easily throwing away things, only to be bought again. But what if it were possible to get off this hamster wheel of consumption? What if it were possible to not only identify the "necessary" things (necessary for your lifestyle) you need to live, but buy those for life so that you never have to buy another? In other words, what if we could create a 'durable' lifestyle wherein you never have to buy another product? This may be impossible, but it is an interesting goal that bears further investigation.
