excerpt: I have a morning ritual, like many others. 
---
Every morning I have the same ritual. I get up, drink a big glass of water, and I make coffee.

First, I fill my electric kettle with exactly 8 cups of filtered water from the refrigerator. I set it to boil, then sit. Once it is done boiling, I get a cup, set my Kalita Wave on top of the cup, put a filter in it, then pour the just-boiled water into the empty filter to wet it and warm the cup. While the water is draining, I turn on my grinder full of fresh, locally sourced coffee for a count of 10. The water in the cup gets dumped, the cup with filter and Wave goes on to a kitchen scale, and the coffee grinds are dumped into the Wave. I make sure there are 21 grams of ground coffee (give or take 2 grams), then the scale is zeroed and the Wave is given a tap to level out the grounds. I pour the water slowly into the grounds, working in circles, until all the coffee is wet and there is around 50-70 g of water. The coffee starts blooming and giving off a wonderful smell. After 30 seconds, more water goes in, working the same concentric circles, until there is 150-200 g total. The water drains into the cup, then 50 g more water is added in pulses until 310 g of total volume is reached. After the grounds are dumped and the equipment cleaned, I take my coffee to the couch and sit, sipping slowly.

Recently my wife asked me what I think about while I sit with my coffee in the morning. I don't necessarily think about anything, I told her. She just looked at me kind of funny, in that way I've come to recognize as her loving acceptance of my quirks and eccentricities. But it got me thinking about my coffee ritual, and what I discovered went beyond coffee.

It isn't about the particulars of brewing method, the merits of single-origin beans, or grind size. It is about being mindful, and not living life on autopilot.
