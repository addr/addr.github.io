###I’m a composer of technology that impacts the world for the better.

Like a composer writing music for a symphony of instruments, I thrive on creating harmonious technology and marketing solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts. No one else offers the unique combination of experience, education, attitude, and work ethic to deliver complete solutions in any technology project, rather than just parts of a whole.

I’m driven to systematically unearth what truly makes technology have an impact, not figure out ways to write more code. While others are spending time playing with a shiny new tool, I’m working with the marketing team to figure out what customers want out of our technology and how to get more of that to them. The people and organizations that are most successful will continue to be those that realize on a fundamental level that technology isn’t an end unto itself, but a revolutionary way to solve the most important problems of the marketplace.

After working on projects of all shapes and sizes I’ve made all the mistakes. I’ve seen what happens when things go wrong, and I know how to steer a project back to safety. From Scrum projects to 3 year, $1.5 million ERP implementations, I can help. [Send me an email!](mailto:andy@andydrice.com)
